# Hi! I'm UTWARRIOR99 👋

I'm a teen learning coding and web development (CS major in Grade 12).  
I know **HTML**, **CSS**, and I'm currently learning **Python**.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Learn more about building websites and apps  
- Collaborate on group projects with other devs  
- Earn through freelance or self-built products 💸

## 🧠 What I Bring

I can help with **frontend web development**, contribute code, test ideas, and keep the team's energy high.  
I’m the kind of person who keeps the group laughing while shipping features 😄
